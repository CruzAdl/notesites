Making themselves into men.\n\nVery short, with a very simple point, even though the world has changed s lot since Beard's mother's time, there is still a cultural holdover that at the very least makes it more difficult for women to - reach positions of power - effect change using that power\n\nBeard focuses on prestigious leadership positions, using examples of well-known female politicians. It would have been a longer book, but I would have liked some thoughts on power in mundane settings. Of course what she says applies to home-life, normal non-leadership positions etcetera, but it is left as an exercise for the reader and there might be interesting nuances in these other spheres. The book is effective but it hammers on a bit too much, I believe that's the intention.\n\nAt the very end there is a bit on what to do? One suggestion she makes is to -paraphrasing- \"think about power as an attribute or as a verb\". To power something, easier for me to understand that in the statistics sense, you need a large enough sample to \"power\" an analysis, and it makes sense, anyways.\n\nShould everyone read this book? Probably, it's so short. I imagine many (unfortunately men) would recoil at the title, just like I did. When that happened I almost stopped but I had s thought. Why does this book exist, Mary Beard is a world-class scholar, her field is ancient history, Rome mainly then Greece. Her issue is not feminism, her issue is humanism. She knows and I think I do too know, that most of what's written, about all issues, at all times, and by almost any author, is about and from the perspective of men. Any old non-fiction book that deals with *a thing*, like and event a war or even a concept I guess that could also be war is going to be about the human experience which, in literature has been presented as male. Thinking this, that almost any other book I pickup is written with males at the center, made it not only easy but edged me to continue reading.\n\n10/10\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nMary Beard's manifesto.
