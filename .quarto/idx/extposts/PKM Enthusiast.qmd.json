After all I love the linking of information in Thebrain, the beauty and features of Evernote and Onenote, the unique features of Zotero, the way Obsidian and Logseq can manage markdown and annotate PDFs, the way Eagle.cool can filter and preview data. So, trying to preserve information for long term archiving (ex. SingleFile html, PDF portolios, zip, pdf, etc.), tagging and organizing in folders to find all quickly, creating various formats to adapt in multiple apps required so much time. I have more data unorganized and very large number of bookmarks saved and exported in files. Some people use multiple apps to organize information, I liked (theoretically) the way to use a single one and searched the one that have most of features, UI and speed. And was hard.

Later I save information with SingleFile as html put in Eagle.cool, drag full sized images from articles in the same subfolder and create a thumbnailed bookmark also. I still love many note management software, the way it work and display data. But don’t have time to just organize. The time is required for reading. So not very important information is just saved as html and bookmarked and the next is followed. Requires 1 minute. To copy paste, clean, format, tag, link an article requires much more time, to put in a software that locks the information that later reqs years to export and reorganize is so hard. Most of the tried apps became unusable after a time, because of the number of information, files, images, video, audio attachments I put in. Then the migration started. And after a time a realized the new software can’t support one or more features the previous could handle so well.
