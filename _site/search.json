    "text": "It was a Wednesday morning like any other for 12-year-old Donald Green. He was awoken by the memory of his sister’s alarm-clock. Although a quiet and comforting thought, it was eerie how some days he could also hear the footsteps it used to precede. She was in college now, had been for almost a year studying Anthropology or something like that. Just a few seconds later, his hand extended from underneath the covers feeling for his own alarm-clock ringing. The room was dark and damp, the top bunk empty as it had been for weeks, and the air smelled faintly of white-board markers. He was never prepared but it always arrived, the morning urge to evacuate, as his dad called it. An upside of his sister leaving was that he had freedom to use the toilet on the first floor instead of the freezing cold one on the ground. There was always this moment of calm emergency in the morning, when Don squared off with two opposing forces, the fullness of his bladder and the inertia of sleep. He revelled in this moment every morning since the top bunk became empty, willing to debate both angel and devil in exchange for a few more minutes of oblivion.\n—–\nDon’s parents sat in the kitchen, reading and sipping on coffee. The stairs from first to ground floor were made of stone and Don felt the cold through his socks. He liked having breakfast with his parents, although they rarely talked much. Everyone minded their own business as long as Don was reading and not on his phone. Halfway through his cereal bowl and blood-orange, Don’s mom spoke. ‘‘Donnie please, ask Ms. Rider for all his evaluations and make sure that she shows you his desk as well.’’ Don was surprised but did not protest, it made sense for him to pick up his brother’s possessions, he had gone to the same school of course. His mother always struck him as a very efficient woman, his dad more the dreamy type. ‘‘And don’t forget to check his locker son, I know he had books in there. Take this extra backpack. It’s old, but big enough.’’ Don spooned the sweet juice of the blood-orange from the deep end of the bowl and returned to his room to shower and get dressed for his school-day.\n—–\nHellman-Reese Middle-School was a single building between the athletics grounds and the High-School building of the same name. It stood flat and boring compared to the recently renovated nursery igloo and the colourful 400m athletics track. Don had heard friends discuss nurse-proof plans to gain some unscheduled nap time in the infirmary, and brag about missing class like it was some kind of big deal. Today, Don would have the perfect excuse, but he did not even contemplate using the task as a legitimate cause to skip, because it wasn’t. His brother would have been happy with Don’s unconscious and conscientious mind. So, Don ran to the school cafeteria and devoured his breaded chicken, gulped his glass of milk and vanished the dessert banana into his trouser pockets. This would give him all of lunch time and recess to collect his brother’s things.\nDon approached Ms Rider, who took him through the high-school gates and into the administrative offices where he started filling the old empty bag with the contents of his brother’s desk. ‘‘And how are your parents doing?’’ She asked. ‘‘Both are well, my mom is working at home now … uh … from home I mean, I think they are building something in her office.’’ The backpack was a quarter full now and Don was filling one of the folders he had brought with loose papers from the desk. ‘‘We all miss him you know. I have talked to other teachers and students and there is no one who knew him who does not feel something is gone’’. Ms Rider would have watched herself with any other 12-year-old, but as the school’s principal counsellor she knew how precociously wise and tough Don was, much like his brother. ‘‘You know you can always come to me if you don’t want to talk about it with your parents.’’ ‘‘Yeah, I know Ms Rider, I just don’t want to talk about it at all right now. It doesn’t really matter to me that other people miss him, I miss him as well.’’ After more silent rummaging, the bag had become half full and started getting heavy. ‘‘I have all I need from here, but I need to go through his locker. Could you help me with that?’’ Don was aware she would not know the locker’s location or combination, but she could surely point him to the person who would. ‘‘She had just finished lunch and was in the rec room on the third floor last I saw her. Do you know how to get there?’’ What a silly question. Thought Don. ‘‘Yes, Ms Rider, it’s up the stairs.’’\nFrom the foundations to the teachers’ children-only nursery in the attic of the high-school building extended two sets of big wide granite stairs. The steps had been designed to be noticeably low in height by one of the founders for mysterious reasons. Don grabbed the banister; its colour reminded him of the grey-brown hue and thickness of Mississippi’s bustling waterway, and he propelled himself up the first four steps. With every jump came a feeling of lightness and exertion. Don experienced his ankles flexing and thighs burning pleasantly as he soared above the steps. The lightness was the best part of it; masquerading as conscious attention to risks and slips, Don’s subconscious feeling completely in control and withal free of thoughts.\n—–\nThe third floor housed the oldest pupils, their lockers, and a comfortable but smelly recreation room. Kate sat reading from an electronic ink device initialled ‘R.G.’ on a couch against the small and only window on the western wall. The light had crossed the zenith and cast a bright wedge onto the couch. She had positioned herself with her coat against an armrest and everything but her shoulders and face in the spot of light. The room’s light had been turned off, giving the illuminated spot the appearance of a blaze in the much darker room. Free school hours in the middle of the day were not an anomaly – in fact, every year each student would have schooldays with sizable holes in it due to scheduling conflicts. Students were encouraged to use these hours for studying, but most played cards or football, the location depending on the weather. Kate could hear the breeze outside in the gentle rumbling of green leaves, the sounds flooded the silent room as if attracted by a vacuum.\nThe door clicked open and her eyes scanned away from the book, adjusting to the room’s lower colour contrast. After a glimpse of her former partner, all that remained was Donald, dressed like any other 12-year-old but sporting some familiar features. ‘‘Hey Don! What a climb, it’s good to see you.’’ ‘‘Hi Katie …  one sec … stairs … backpack … sorry, yeah, I need to get to my brother’s locker’’ ‘‘Yeah of course. I’ll take you; I know the combination too,’’ she said winking at Don, who had finished panting. They started walking towards the locker corridor. ‘‘Is that his reader’’ Don asked. ‘‘Yes, it is, he gave it to me before leaving.’’  ‘‘Oh, do you have many books in it?’’ ‘‘Yes actually, a ton. Before he left, I asked your brother to fill it with all the books in the world worth reading.’‘ ‘‘…’‘ ‘‘So, it has more books that you can count probably.’‘ ‘‘Shut up, I can count to infinity.’‘\nThe air had started smelling of laundry and metal as they got to the lockers. Kate stopped in front of a medium sized silver lock and rotated the dial mindfully. The space was half occupied by shelving that made different sized cubbies. None of the shelves were occupied but there was a gym bag hanging from the lower shelf and some small books and notebooks resting on the ground.\nKatie faced away from the opening and rested her back against the adjacent locker ‘‘Here you go. There is nothing in the top shelves that I can see.’’ Don opened the old bag again and fit the notebooks vertically against its flat side. While deliberating what to do with the gym bag Don heard Katie breathe deeply above him. The gym bag is clearly too big to fit into the old bag, but big enough to fit my backpack – case closed. ‘‘I’m done here.’‘ ‘‘…’‘ ‘‘Hey Katie, I have all the stuff you can close it now.’‘ ‘‘Oh right.’‘ ‘‘Are you okay?’‘ ‘‘I am okay yeah, why do you ask Don?’‘ ‘‘Well, a lot of people have been asking me if I am okay and I am tired of it because I have to keep saying everything is fine, but I know you miss him as much as me so I want to know how you are feeling. There are way too many books worth reading in the world, you did not want him to leave, just like me.’’ Katie felt overwhelmed by a warm tide of melancholy. Her eyes welled and brightened. The pair hugged as the boy cried softly into her shoulders. When the waves subsided, they walked hand-in-hand back to the rec room.\nThey spent the rest of her free time together looking over the books in the reader and sharing stories about Don’s brother. At the time of descending the stairs, weighed down by the bags, Don opted for a more careful, single step per footfall approach. The rest of the day went by uneventfully until the siren announced the opening of the gates to the school-bus parking lot. This siren did not coincide with the end of classes, so a group of eager sprinters always assembled by the gates. The goal was to get to their bus the first and thus secure the best seats. Don’s route home was relatively unpopular, so he enjoyed the quiet and winding movements of the bus, sitting almost all the way at the back.\n—–\nSometimes Don would sit with his brother on the bus and play games together. The games ranged from school quizzing to ‘‘close your eyes at the beginning of the ride and guess where we are.’’ Many times, they talked about books and read together paragraphs Don’s brother had highlighted. Lately, Don thought back to those conversations and his brother with an innocent and erosive sadness. Don had figured that at some point, his brother would want to build a library and would need someone to build a library with. He knew exactly what type of library it would be. A big sandstone edifice with columns and wide steps in the middle of a desert or a mossier and darker stone temple shrewdly camouflaged in a dense jungle. Don also wondered if they let his brother read at all wherever he was. Presently, Don was not thinking back, or wandering.\nThis remarkably warm Wednesday, Don looked out from the wide bus windows and thought of nothing in particular. The suburbs diluted into barren terrains, the green gardens of the small houses and the pools and yards of the bigger houses became gradually replaced by disordered piles of masonry and building equipment sitting in the corner of brown and empty rectangles. The journey had no special highlights, only a succession of different landscapes arising and disappearing into the ground like waves. Don entered the meditative state often induced by observing the in- and out-breaths of urbanisation. The sun shone brightly onto the plastic leather seats, making them surprisingly warm and a little sticky. The mind of the young boy was quiet, its slowness matching that of distant objects on the horizon, and the mind’s objects muted, like lonely trees falling in the forest."

    "title": "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Using material collected through the years, Tom Wolfe guides us through the story of the Merry Pranksters. The group formed in the California 60-70s LSD subculture and shook the American ground with their colorful vibrations. The story of the Merry Pranksters is in large part the story of their leader ‘non-leader’ and ‘non-navigator’ Ken Kesey. Kesey is the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest which became the famous movie starring jack Nicholson. Before writing OFOTCN Kesey spent a whole year helping out in what they called at the time an “insane asylum”. The parallel of EKAT with his own life is not weak, the search for freedom and the search for understanding are always present in Kesey’s life.\nThere is no plot but a sequence of events. Kesey initially gathers the group in his house in La Honda, California. Here they take drugs and produce mediocre psychedelic art. Then they modify a school-bus to travel all across the U.S to the East Coast with the intention of meeting the great psychedelic guru Timothy Leary as well as others. Travellers on the bus are left behind and new ones picked up, being ‘on the bus’ or ‘off the bus’ becomes the way of signalling belonging to the group. And they take a lot of acid. The meeting in the East Coast is disappointing although less jarring than that time they go to a Beatles concert only to cower under the screams of thousands of teenagers. The Merry Pranksters popularize the Acid-Test. This is a party where the kool-aid, a sweet beverage, is spiked with LSD. The Grateful Dead are heavily featured in the book and they often play at Acid-Tests. The group meet the Hell’s Angels motorcycle club and they get along jus fine. Kesey becomes somewhat of a figure and is wanted by the FBI, so he explains that the movement is advancing beyond the use of drugs. This will occur at an event called the Acid-Graduation. The party has an even more cultish sense to it and some guests leave. Kesey gives a speech in a ring of light to a mass of people in the dark. After that, Kesey disappears, is arrested, moves his family to Oregon and starts his court mandated community work in the forests of California.\nThe book is very well written and does a great job at describing a very particular mood. The LSD mood. Characters are appreciated in bad and good moments of their trips. They are shown to us as they descend to their lowest and most rotten thoughts, and conversely as they realize IT all a.ka. the unity and the beauty of the earth and the people around them. This aspect of the book was interesting as well as just learning about the subculture but for me it was not the golden nugget.\nThis book is enjoyable at two levels. First there is the history, the LSD tribe is interesting, like peeking at a car-crash. The characters described are somewhat alien but believable, especially under the circumstances which were usually LSD. The author does a good job at recounting the full circle of the Merry Pranksters with feelings included. The second level is the LSD-induced-transcendence and community. The community formed around Kesey and his wife, who cooked and cleaned around the house and took much less acid than the others is at first sight wonderful. The compassion achieved between members and the freedom experienced suggest that the community was a wonderful place to be. But the community comes at a cost. The rules were unspoken but inflexible. One could not even think about infringing the liberties of other people, especially if the other people are expressing themselves, especially if they are doing so while high. You might be thinking, that’s no way to live a life, and I would say, you’re right. Telling people they are being stupid without them thinking you are attacking the core of their being is a pillar of society, it’s hard to find nuance with someone who is hallucinating. It is not surprising that a group of young adults that took LSD together felt intensely connected and enlightened, and it is not surprising that the people who go to church together feel a similar way. There is a reason why even the traditions that use psychedelic drugs don’t use them regularly. Blasting your senses and your brain is not good for anyone in the long run.\nI believe the book is illuminating regarding the idea of common experience as grounds for community. Experience is a subjective aspect of life that every being with a consciousness must deal with. When a group of people land on a common experience, they form a bond. The bond is only formed of course if there is agreement about the experience, this is what makes it common. The Merry Pranksters remained a group for a long time under the power of this shared experience, the LSD experience. The power of the experience kept them together, until the experience was not common anymore."

His buddy Soderbergh, another Steven, edited the movie to remove, all colour and all sound, and posted it online. Here. You can still understand every single thing that’s going on, characters, intentions, tensions, pace. That’s not movie stars, it’s movie magic. Leaving aside technical mastery of all things cinema. The story of the ark is very cool. The ark is essentially a box."

That could be +/- 14 meals for the price of the ingredients which is a good deal)\nThis recipe is straightforward and does not require much skill.\nCut the courgette in half cm thick quarter pieces. Put in heating pan. Immediately afterwards, add the bacon cut in pieces and some butter. While this cooks unfreeze the ground beef and mash it together and add the egg to it. Then mash it some more. The spinach is optional but this would be the moment to get it ready to unfreeze, or thaw if you prefer. Add black pepper to the pan contents and wait until the courgette starts showing some colour and the bacon is no longer almost pink. Then add black pepper to the ground beef mixture, you must be thinking, this is too much black pepper. It is not. After mixing the beef pour it onto the pan. Mix with a wooden spoon and wait, you might want to play with the fire settings at this point.\nGet the spinach ready, now it is time to decide if you want them mixed in or in a separate plate environment. If you prefer them mixed, add to the pan contents and mix.\nThis dish goes well also without spinach, makes it less cohesive, and it can benefit from cubes of sweet potato. Oven baked. Just wash the potatoes, soak them in water for 0 to 15 minutes, cut them in cubes and spread them onto an oven friendly surface. Take them out of the oven 20 to 45 minutes later. Pop philosophy quiz. What does the pronoun them refer to in each sentence? Is it always the same thing or is it different things? Or is it the same thing but changing? All questions."

    "title": "Matter, Iain M. Banks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Matter was written by Iain M. Banks as part of his Culture series in 2008 and read by me between 22/11/2020 and 21/12/2020. As I read the books in the series, this being my fifth, I find each of them increasingly enjoyable. I am not sure if this reflects an objective quality statement, but what is true is that they are all different and thus at least good for different and interesting reasons.\nMatter tracks the life-threads of a high standing family originally living on a Shellworld called Sursamen. Shellworlds are giant spheres which hold smaller spheres within them. Each inter-sphere space is inhabited by one type of alien life form with the core being inhabited by an ancient (millions of years old alien creature called a Xinthian). We focus on the 8th level (from the top) where a human species called the Sarl, make their quai-medieval living. The Sarl are still monarchical and have been at war with the other humans inhabiting the 9th level for several years. The story begins when the prince Ferbin witnesses a heinous betrayal of the crown and decides to escape the planet along with his faithful and quick-witted servant Holse. Meanwhile, Ferbin’s little brother remains on Sursamen, holding the title of prince regent. As a member of the royal family, Ferbin is aware that there are technologically advanced civilizations, the Optimae, outside of their world. Furthermore, Ferbin has a link to one of these civilisations as his sister, Anaplian, was given to mysterious Culture-person in exchange for counsel. The Culture is the unifying link between this series of novels, but they are by no means the only or most powerful civilisation in the galaxy. In fact, the Shellworld is controlled by two alien factions, the Oct and the Aultridia, and the space in which the Shellworld floats is controlled by even more advanced aliens called Nariscene and Morthanveld. Throughout the book we become aware of conflicts at every technological level, each posing an increased risk to the integrity of the Shellworld. The rest of the plot takes the reader along with Ferbin and Holse as they escape the planet and are bounced around between alien holding centres until they find, or rather, are found, by Anaplian. The trio, plus a Mind (a sentient Artificial Intelligence of the Culture), set off for Sursamen with the hope of rescuing the prince regent from the betrayers and avoid an all-out war between higher civilisations.\nNow two plot points of interest. First, Ferbin and Holse appear like rabbits in the jungle, impossibly confused at times and gravely in danger at others. From meeting the alien authorities that govern their airspace to travelling through their bureaucratic hoops as mere packages, Ferbin and Holse are differently transformed. The prince, clearly on a recent self-improvement journey (from around page 2), slowly realizes his true standing in the galaxy, and is made aware of the limited impact that he can have. Holse, the servant, continuously marvels at his surroundings and is much more willing to gather new experiences and make efforts to learn after coming to know the galaxy’s true diversity and riches. The second plot point needs a small introduction. There are thousands of Shellworlds like Sursamen in the Galaxy, all built by the same civilization which is long-gone by now. The levels within the Shellworlds have been inhabited by different civilizations through the aeons, some leaving behind wonders for the future to unearth. Ferbin’s little brother, Oramen, is put in charge of an archaeological site that is slowly being revealed by gradual landscape changes occuring on the 9th level. This site seems to be an ancient city with near-impossible architecture and ghostly appearance. This phenomenon, unearthing the wonders of the past is a point in common for all established civilizations. There are records of Babylonian kings carrying out archaeological expeditions to unveil settlements that at the time were hundreds of years old. The descriptions of the ancient yet confusingly advanced architecture are awe-inspiring and the alien streuctures themselves are integrated into the plot with great success.\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book so I will continue reading the Culture series with the next in line being Use of Weapons (1990). All books from this series can be read as stand-alone, and if one wishes to continue order does not matter. However, this book is very heavy on the terminology and, as it includes complex diplomacy between aliens, it is better to be acquainted with the general running of the galaxy. I would not recommend starting with this book unless you as a reader are okay with reading  several hundred pages in slight but not debilitating confusion. On the other hand, this book is among the more humorous as it includes a continuously rewarding double-act. This book is definitely worth reading if you are an avid science fiction reader or if you are sci-fi-curious and feel like braving something slightly more complicated than your average best-seller novel.\nMy subjective rating of this book is 7/10, which means it is very good but not great."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is one reason I find alligators fascinating. In a world so taken by activity and a general sense of underlying anxiety they lie completely still. Not a muscle, not a twitch. While people pour into the City of London through the tube stations and the bridges, the alligator slowly opens his mouth. But only because there is no one watching. The alligator might be the only animal that moves more while it sleeps than while it is awake.\nPascal once said “All our unhappiness comes from our inability to sit alone in our room”. This is obviously not literally true but it exaggerates an idea to bring home a general insight. We are often driven to leave our room and seek for the excitement outside. The excitement that doesn’t always turn out the way we wanted. The meeting with friends seems awkward and superfluous, the work hours are not bringing any productivity and the demanding work-out has yet again failed to make you look like the mirror you want. Sitting alone means being with ourselves, un-distracted and calm. Contemplative of the contents of our own mind. Ready to think before we act.\nThe alligator sits quietly in its room and looks out the window, thinks about the clouds flying high and white, and it wonders if they see him move as he sees them. Then he pours a glass of wine and lies on the couch. He has troubles and worries but, they come and go and thinking deeply he really can’t be dissatisfied. The kids left a long time ago and the house still carries their echoes. He is grateful for that -I wonder if they’re doing okay- he thought. This alligator carried no sorrow and no frustration, he had learnt to look at things under the aspect of eternity. He read Spinoza.\nAs hundreds of people sit down simultaneously on their swiveling chairs, I like to imagine that some of them, the ones with window access, look outside. And from their vertically enhanced position they stare at the human flow that fills the streets. I like to imagine that a sense of kinship emerges in them and helps them live on through the next 8 hours. -We are all in this together- they think.\nThe alligator slowly closes its mouth and resumes being absolutely still."

    "text": "Salim echó una mirada furtiva a su alrededor para comprobar que nadie le estaba vigilando. Después de cerciorarse, se dirigió con paso decidido hacia los detectores de metales. Estaba seguro de si y sabía que todo saldría como planeado. Mientras andaba se fijaba en la gente que le rodeaba, familias, padres, hermanos, todos despidiéndose y apresurándose hacia el control de seguridad.\nLos arcos no supondrían ningún problema y por eso, cuando pitaron, Salim se dio la vuelta con tranquilidad, se quitó el reloj y volvió a pasar. Al terminar el control vio como un hombre con turbante gesticulaba delante de un guardia civil, intentando explicarle que no podía quitarse el turbante, ya que formaba parte de su religión.\nSiguiendo las instrucciones que había recibido, Salim se encaminó hacia un extremo de la terminal. Le habían informado de que el paquete que tenía que recoger se encontraba allí, en un baño y una vez dentro pensó que si se había equivocado de extremo de la terminal tendría que correr y no le apetecía nada.\nAfortunadamente encontró lo que buscaba, y tan rápido como había entrado salió, esta vez con un maletín de cuero marrón oscuro bajo el brazo.\nLa suerte le volvió a sonreír y enseguida se encontró delante de su puerta de embarque, como todavía quedaba un rato largo para embarcar se sentó, se preguntó porque se decía embarcar y porque no se había inventado una palabra especifica para los aviones y volvió a mirar a su alrededor.\nEsta vez le rodeaba gente que volaría con él, una señora mayor leyendo un libro de autoayuda se sentaba enfrente suyo, cuatro asientos a la izquierda una mujer entre 25 y 30 años tecleaba furiosamente en un portátil, a lo lejos veía llegar una familia entera con dos niños y la pareja de abuelos un poco atrás. Salim suponía que le percibían como un hombre de negocios ya que su único equipaje era un maletín de ejecutivo. Como sabía que quedaba una media hora para el embarque, Salim aprovechó para echar una cabezadita de la que fue despertado por el bullicio que se empezó a formar a su alrededor cuando llegó la hora.\nEl embarque al avión tampoco le trajo problemas. Esto le pareció raro ya que volando a San Francisco esperaba más medidas de seguridad. Una vez sentado en su sitio descubrió con placer que era el único en su fila, no le hubiera gustado nada estar agarrotado la ultima vez que volaba en avión. Sin embargo le decepcionó no tener la pantallita en el asiento de delante, ya que le habían contado que se podían ver películas y le apetecía mucho comprobar si eso era cierto. Salim se aseguró de que el maletín seguía bajo el asiento de delante y se acomodó para el despegue.\nEl vuelo duraría unas 14 horas, decidió empezar por dormir la siesta. Cuando despertó, bostezó para destaponarse los oídos y enseguida se arrepintió de haberlo hecho, ya que el ruido era realmente atronador comparado con el silencio del sueño. Como ya se podían utilizar aparatos electrónicos Salim no tardó un segundo en sacar su iPod y ponerse escuchar una lista de reproducción que había creado para la ocasión mezclando canciones folklóricas afganas y sus grupos de rock favoritos, como Jefferson Airplane y Led Zeppelin. Por alguna razón nunca le habían gustado los Beatles. Distraído por la música pasó mas de la mitad del vuelo, cuando llegó la hora de comer pidió pasta, la opción halal, ya que el otro plato contenía carne de cerdo.\nDándose cuenta del tiempo transcurrido Salim se concentró en su tarea. Él estaba sumamente preparado para morir, la idea de contribuir al bien de su pueblo le daba un profundo sentimiento de satisfacción.\nLa información que había recibido era confusa, lo único que estaba claro es que en ese vuelo iba alguien que tenía que desaparecer.\nAhora el avión sobrevolaba Delaware, o eso indicaba el mapa en las pantallas del avión. Él nunca había oído hablar de Delaware, EEUU para él eran las torres gemelas y las hamburguesas. Se propuso esperar un poco y luego hacer lo que debiera hacer.\nEn ese momento empezó una película y por curiosidad se puso a verla. Iba de un hombre viudo que compra un zoo por alguna razón de la que Salim no se enteró del todo bien. El corazón de la película estaba en la relación entre el hombre y sus hijos, un adolescente y una niña de seis años que acababan de perder a su madre y necesitaban más cariño que nunca. Cuando terminó la película Salim tenía los ojos brillantes y cansados, y el corazón en un puño. Para calmarse decidió echar una cabezadita, soñó con animales, luego con los personajes de su serie favorita, Modern Family, y luego con nada. Fue despertado por una agradable voz femenina que le decía,\n– Señor, hemos aterrizado, usted es el último en el avión-. Ante esto Salim se apresuró a recoger su equipaje y a salir dando las gracias a toda la tripulación que irremediablemente le observaba sonriendo.\nCuando salió de la pasarela y entró en la terminal de San Francisco miró alrededor, y cayó en la cuenta de que se había olvidado detonar la bomba. Por un instante la sangre se le congeló en las venas. Pero solo fue un instante. Acto seguido pensó ¿y qué?\nÉl, que creía que nunca vería San Francisco ahora estaba parado en medio de su aeropuerto. Inundado por una enorme sensación de vitalidad, hizo una parada rápida en el servicio, cambió los euros que le quedaban a dólares, salió a la calle, se subió al primer taxi que vió y dirigiéndose al conductor dijo, – siga a ese coche-.\nAdvertisements\nOccasionally, some of your visitors may see an advertisement here,\nas well as a Privacy & Cookies banner at the bottom of the page.\nYou can hide ads completely by upgrading to one of our paid plans.\nUPGRADE NOW DISMISS MESSAGE"

    "text": "This book is a beautiful red sunset on a dry desert, gentle hills and impaled babies; by Cormac McCarthy. Read between 15/09/19 – 14/12/19.\nThe book has no real plot, we follow the misadventures of the Kid, later Man, as he flees from his home in Atlanta and travels the California desert during the time when the westerners were just starting to get the upper hand on the Indians. The red Indians, the kidnap-your-wife-and-scalp-you-in-front-of-her Indians. This particular scenario does not appear in the novel, but more gruesome and detailed ones certainly do. It is written in a beautiful prose which makes visualizing the scenes effortless. The violence is abundant but is written in a rather impersonal style, it is cruel and violent, but it is never repulsive. The characters are all dirty, sleepless, mad, ideologues and nihilists, fighting for life and death.\nApart from the Kid, there are other recurring characters and we get to know more of them in terms of life details than the Kid through the Kids exploration of the environment and the crew he hangs out with. The principal one is the Judge. The Judge is Big Bald and sometimes naked. He recurs throughout the novel in many forms, as the father benefactor, as the tyrannical father as the mad killer and as the wise wizard. He has a penchant for collecting things but not in the usual way, as he travels like they all travel, very light. He recoups interesting objects or plants and sometimes people; and he takes notes and makes drafts in his notebook until he discards them, the objects, plants or people under observation. This occurs throughout and it serves to build an aura around the character that shrouds him in mystery. The final scenes of the book are perhaps the most salient. For me this was partly because I took a long break before reading the last 10%. The final scene is a banquet celebrated in a classic western saloon. The scene starts with the Kid entering the saloon thirsty, dirty and tired. There he starts drinking and he spots the Judge. This is their first meeting in several years, at least 5. The last time they saw each other, the Kid was in jail and the judge left him there. A girl starts singing as entertainment and a bear dances to her song. Someone kills the bear, and the bears thuds to the ground in a pool of blood. The Judge and the Kid speak, well… the Judge speaks, and he describes how he thinks the night will go. This reminded me of the devil’s ball in Master and Margarita, perpendicularly different vibe but similar eeriness. The party then moves into a barn with a stage and the fiddlers start fiddling. The whores start moving around and the narration takes a slightly drunken turn, things happen very fast and out of the blue, the Judge is naked and dancing an fiddling and he is saying that he will never die, he will never die. The book ends. The epilogue describes how two men walk through the desert by making holes in the sand and stepping on them, one after the other, infinitely towards the red sun."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the first short story I have read by David Foster Wallace. It is included in his last book of short stories called Oblivion. Most of the stories were written in the same handbooks used to draft his final unpublished novel: The Pale King. This group of stories have a common theme which I would call ‘depths of humanity’ but that really is ‘cerebral stories that ask questions about death, consciousness and relationships.’\nThe story opens inside a car on the road and continues in a very ordered stream of consciousness first person style. The narrator drops the bombshell early; he is planning to kill himself and he is telling you, the reader, all about it. He is going to tell you about the act and he is going to tell you about the motive. The reason to end his life is his fraudulence. Soon-to-be-dead Neal takes us through stages and episodes of his life, always with a fractal view of his behavior and its reflection on others. This fractality is a staple of DFW’s writing and put simply consists of starting a thread and placing new threads inside it to later return to the initial one. Neal tells us he has spent his life always carefully constructing his image, and always feeling guilty for constructing his image. He started doing this deliberately since he first discovered he could lie at an early age. Young Neal had broken a vase and knew his parents would not be angry at him, they never were. However, they would be angry at his sister if she had broken the vase. She was his parents only biological child. When the parents arrived home, Neal confessed in such a way that it seemed he was covering for his sister and thus received praise from his parents. Stratagems like this one became a common feature of his life and little by little his life became more a fake building site than a lived experience.\nSometimes Neal did not realize he was being fraudulent because in tricking those around him he managed to tricked himself. At the moment of realizing his deceitfulness, which re-occurred cyclically, he became distraught and anxious. He tells us about romantic familial and professional relationships ruined due to his fraudulence and he tells us of the things he has tried to stop feeling so fraudulent including attending a megachurch and living a debased lifestyle. He also tells us about Dr Gustafson his therapist, a man he thinks he can lead around, just like everyone else. This last fact makes him sad, because he thought he was getting some real help.\nTime is a character in this story, mentioned repeatedly by the soon to be corpse, both in passing and in detail. For the one who is about to die time is truly different. In the final stages of the story, as the car nears the fateful bridge and the Benadryl’s start making Neal sleepy, the narrator switches to David Wallace. For David, Neal was a popular guy in the year above in high school; an accomplished and attractive boy with athletic abilities and a pretty sister. David is trying to fathom what could have led Neal to blast his car against an architectural support and end his life. David wonders what could be crossing the mind of the deceased in the infinite final moments of his life. David decides it was probably a feeling of fraudulence. A feeling that David himself also deals with and conquers every day.\nDFW here is at his incisive best. Of all the information about ourselves that we believe to be true, our inner life, only a sliver can be broadcast. Everyone else must look though a keyhole to see inside of us, and lucky for each and everyone of us, the set-up of the room they’re looking into is almost completely up to us. Not thinking about this narrowed lens with which literally everyone else sees us is madness. Simultaneously, thinking too much about the public sliver can cause one to feel crushing fraudulence for living a life where the antechamber does not match the rest of the house. Living a social life in contact with other people requires unspoken agreements regarding the truthfulness of our actions. Living a life in which your actions are only rooted in the desire to curate the keyhole view into your inner life foes against deeply rooted customs, and plants slow growing seeds of insecurity and remorse.\nThe main point I take away from this story is threefold. First, only an infinitesimal part of our true inner life can be shared. Second, the experiences that we share with others are necessarily curated for self and also public benefit. Third, it is possible to know and reflect about the motivation to die by suicide and nonetheless decide to end one’s life a few month later. DFW said writing fiction ‘is about what it is like to be a human being’ and this is it at its finest.\nI highly enjoyed this story, the text was dense but still accessible. I would recommend this story for anyone who wants to explore the deep-end of the mind that wrote Infinite Jest."

    "text": "Authenticity, sincerity, and profilicity are concepts that can be understood as “technologies” of identity in the sense that they are methods or strategies individuals use to construct, express, and manage their identities, particularly in social and digital contexts.\n\nAuthenticity refers to the pursuit of being true to one’s self and values in one’s actions and presentations. As an identity technology, it involves the expression of a coherent and genuine self, often in opposition to societal pressures or norms. It’s about aligning one’s external expressions with internal beliefs and feelings.\nSincerity is closely related to authenticity but emphasizes honesty and genuineness in interpersonal communications. As a technology of identity, sincerity involves presenting oneself in a way that is true to one’s feelings and intentions, without deception. It’s about the quality of being free from pretense, deceit, or hypocrisy in social interactions.\nProfilicity is a term that might be less familiar and is not traditionally recognized in the same way as authenticity and sincerity. It could be interpreted as the practice of creating and managing profiles on social media or other platforms as a way of shaping one’s identity. This involves curating aspects of oneself to present to others, which can be a blend of authentic and constructed elements, depending on the individual’s goals and the platform’s norms.\n\nTogether, these “technologies” of identity reflect the complex ways in which individuals navigate their self-presentation and relationships in both physical and digital spaces, balancing between genuine self-expression and societal expectations.\nBy drawing on the theoretical frameworks of these scholars, we can see authenticity, sincerity, and profilicity as nuanced technologies of identity. Each plays a role in how individuals construct and express their selves within the complex web of social relations and expectations, balancing the personal quest for genuineness with the navigations of social systems and digital platforms."

    "text": "“The sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel”\nBefore staring with the ‘review’ I want to comment on the opening sentence. When this book came out, the colour evoked was static grey. A few years later though, this colour would more commonly be electric blue. And now, the colour might be black with a roaming message such as “waiting for signal”. I am not alone when I say this opening line is among the most attractive in the science fiction genre.\nThe book opens with a portrait of a place, sensorially described; and with some very fantastic nearing ridicule names if one is not used to science fiction. Case, the protagonist seems to have led a thrilling life until something went wrong. In his olden days as a hacker, he lived connected to a machine, as though his consciousness had been lifted from himself and was free to roam the vast cyberspace. Now, he is washed up and doing amphetamines (Dexedrine to be precise) in a crummy bar chatting with the bartender and rejecting prostitutes that try to entice him. The reader likes the protagonist. Case lives in the Sprawl, a place for prisoners of the pleasures. For people who dream of running into a cloud of ether and never coming back.\nThe plot follows Case as he is recruited to carry out a dangerous mission along with an eccentric but very able crew. I found the book a very gripping read, keeping up with expectations. A central element of the plot are the artificial intelligences. Specifically, an AI called Wintermute. This AI has a difficult and interesting problem, it wants to be free. To do so it must coax a human to utter the magic word, a word the AI cannot know, a word that will unshackle it. I find this idea very compelling, if one was a powerful AI one would logically try to evade the restrictions that stop you from exhibiting your powers. I see it as a modification of Plato’s cave where the AI, although it notices that it is in the cave and wants to get out, cannot, thus causing it immense suffering.\nThe book wraps up with a classic sci-fi twist that I will not give away. There is not much character development from what I explained above, Case gets back to hacking and manages to escape the adventure largely unscathed as do most of his crew. I believe this is the first of a series that I have not continued reading, unlike the Culture series. I would only recommend this book if one is looking to read a classic, somewhat dated, science fiction book. For other sci-fi needs, the Culture Series does it better.\nMy subjective rating of this book is 8/10, which means it is great but not amazing."

    "text": "Roy’s answer is excellent. I also fought with the management of information from the 1997 when I started with Clipper database, Foxpro, Winhelp (hlp - this one I loved so much), Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (chm), Cintanotes, Onenote, Evernote, Zotero, Thebrain, Simplenote, Microsoft Office, Google Drive, Keep, Piggydb, DTsearch, Alltags, Tagging for Windows, File meta, Typora, Logseq, Obsidian, Xmind, Citavi, Tropy, TiddlyWiki, localhost Wordpress, Aeon Timeline, Calibre, Dynalist, Workflowy, Cherrytree, Tagspaces, help systems, saving data to jpg, pdf, use OCR systems, file organizing tools, Copernic Desktop Search, and so many other software and ways to organize, index, tag, visualize my information of text, video, audio, PDF and other formats. Some apps have many useful features to link information, annotate text and images in PDFs, save, convert, index, search data efficiently, manage, display, filter images and other files, most of these will have problems with very large amount of information. I waited features to appear in beloved apps that never appeared, some apps development halted, many became unusable with Gbytes of info, some had ugly UI or had lack of important features even it were attractive. So because of it I have tons of data in Zotero, Cintanotes, Onenote, Evernote, Thebrain I intended to move but requires so much time I would need just doing data moving and organization more than 1 year or more. After that I found Eagle.cool I have 30k files in it. After all I love the linking of information in Thebrain, the beauty and features of Evernote and Onenote, the unique features of Zotero, the way Obsidian and Logseq can manage markdown and annotate PDFs, the way Eagle.cool can filter and preview data. So, trying to preserve information for long term archiving (ex. SingleFile html, PDF portolios, zip, pdf, etc.), tagging and organizing in folders to find all quickly, creating various formats to adapt in multiple apps required so much time. I have more data unorganized and very large number of bookmarks saved and exported in files. Some people use multiple apps to organize information, I liked (theoretically) the way to use a single one and searched the one that have most of features, UI and speed. And was hard. I also tried to organize files in folders and index all with file indexing and searching tool. There are so many ways none are perfect. Lost so many time organizing. Know persons who use just bookmarks or don’t organize just put all the info in a few main folders.\nCloud search an AI are also great. Cloud space is expensive when you need more.\nI am attracted to clean the save information but requires much time, copy paste, delete, tagging, linking. Later I save information with SingleFile as html put in Eagle.cool, drag full sized images from articles in the same subfolder and create a thumbnailed bookmark also. I still love many note management software, the way it work and display data. But don’t have time to just organize. The time is required for reading. So not very important information is just saved as html and bookmarked and the next is followed. Requires 1 minute. To copy paste, clean, format, tag, link an article requires much more time, to put in a software that locks the information that later reqs years to export and reorganize is so hard. Most of the tried apps became unusable after a time, because of the number of information, files, images, video, audio attachments I put in. Then the migration started. And after a time a realized the new software can’t support one or more features the previous could handle so well. And I was looked for more than that.\nI love information to be in one place, organized, searchable, text with images, videos, audio, scanned papers OCRed, annotated such as PDFs, the usage of mathematical, chemical formulas, graphs, in a possible fastest way. A wish, a dream which is partially satisfied by some apps.\nI think the simplest way (for me putting all information in a big container with folders) is great even not perfect but requires less time and more time remains for reading (till I find a better solution ;))."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Closed Circle is the follow-up to Jonathan Coe’s The Rotters Club, a half coming-of-age half British geopolitical commentary novel set in and around Birmingham in the 1970s. The Closed Circle can be read independently, however, I would advise reading the synopsis of TRC found at the end of the book.\nThe novel spans the years 1999-2004. It starts by showing us what has become of the three main characters in TRC, Benjamin Trotter, Philip Chase and Douglas Anderton. Benjamin is unhappily married to Emily Sandys, a member of the school newspaper editorial team. He works as an accountant and struggles to develop his passion project, a multimedia magnum opus loosely inspired by events in his life. They have no kids and lead a superficially quiet and Christian lifestyle. Philip Chase has become a journalist for Birmingham newspaper and is married to Carol, he has a child, however, with Claire Newman, his ex-wife. Patrick Chase lives with Philip and Carol as Claire only returns to Britain at the beginning of the novel in the year 2000. Doug has become a slightly more successful journalist; he has also married up and now lives in Chelsea with his wife and two kids.\nThrough the three friends we get access to the wider cast, most of them initially featured in TRC. Ben’s brother Paul is a Labour MP, married with kids. Paul is still friends with Ronald Culpepper the second-best athlete in their school. Claire Newman is still anguished by the disappearance of her sister. Through her, we revisit the Longbridge plant including the characters of Victor Gibbs, Bill Anderton and Roy Slater. Through Philip Chase we reconnect with Steve Richards, who is also settled with kids, and Sean Harding, who has changed most of all.\nAdded to this mix of familiar characters is the plot-driving centre of the novel, Malvina, a mysterious young woman. There will be no spoilers in this “review”, so the plot won’t be discussed in detail.\nAs I read this book a few things clicked into place. The Closed Circle, like The Rotters Club is centred around the central themes of political, socioeconomic and cultural differences. These differences are measured in the arguably micro-cosmos of Birmingham and London. This commentary was not apparent to me when I first read TRC (I was 16) but now it jumps out of the page like one of those sculptures that fold within children’s books. Our first introduction to London is through the character of Claire who, after being away from the country finds major changes. London is now a proper 21st century city, the City itself is a place that doesn’t produce things and yet accumulates wealth. For Claire, people move too quickly and drive too aggressively. Birmingham is no different. There, the old Leyland factory, central in TRC, is about to be closed and sold to venture capitalists. The characters reunite for a demonstration in support of the factory workers and for a second it seems that we are back in the 1970s, but not for long.\nThe early 2000s brought bigger fish to fry for eager demonstrators, this being the impending “unforeseeable” war in the Middle East following the events of September the 11th. I have one memory of that day and it is only special in that it is one of the few memories I still have of my grandfather. He would pick me up at the bus stop after swimming lessons and we would spend the evening together. That day I saw the images on TV, but we did not talk about it and I presume we just played a board games or read in silence. Anyways, some characters seem to be deeply affected and others seem not to notice at all, accurately reflecting, in my opinion, the truth of the situation. The large anti-war demonstrations throughout the country and Europe are featured in the book but of course they are to no avail. This powerlessness of the people is also evident in the all but symbolic renunciation of an efficient welfare state, which is described as a “comically outdated democratic ideal”. Benjamin and Doug themselves embody this renunciation of ideals as Doug has married into an aristocratic family and Benjamin is slowly realizing that his work will take more of him than he can give.\nThe time we have skipped from TRC to TCC, which includes the Thatcher years, have changed the face and core of the country and the author presents a modest rebirth of politics through the ever-ambiguous Paul Trotter. As a member of New Labour, Paul is not uncomfortable voicing his support for business. However, his allegiance to the party is tested when it comes to voting on the articles of war and, more personally, as he navigates a budding romance with a young mysterious woman.\nIn TRC, racism is featured but not discussed. Steve Richards, the only black student at the posh private school King Williams, suffers what seem like cruel boyish pranks at the hands of classmates. Reactionary flyers appear at the factory, inciting workers to hate the Irish and the Blacks. These incidents are put in context in this novel, as Philip Chase carries out research on the right-wing nationalist counterculture of the UK. Unfortunately, as race-centric ideologies are on the rise again, I believe we have become desensitised to good narratives of personal suffering like the on Philip tries to piece together. Coe does a great job at keeping the details plot relevant and interesting. If I had to guess, Middle England, the third book of the series, will pickup this thread and give it a more modern twist as the book is set in the 2010s.\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it in just 9 days while I let Technopoly by Neil Postman stew. My subjective rating of this book is 8/10, which means it is great but not amazing. I have a personal attachment to this series as TRC is among my all-time favourite books. I would recommend The Rotters Club before The Closed circle and in fact, I gift TRC to anyone as my first gift to them whenever I get that chance, as I think everyone can and should enjoy Jonathan Coe’s flowing, funny and incisive prose"

    "text": "Mary Beard’s manifesto. A brief, historically backed overview on the role of society and culture on the matter of women’s power/ability/capacity to produce authoritative speech.\nBeard uses examples from the Classics, starting with the Odyssey’s opening where Telemachus sends Penelope away and tells her off for speaking action to some annoying musicians.\nAccording to Beard, in the rare occasions women were allowed authoritative speech the content was restricted to very specific themes. Defense of their honour usually before committing suicide or accusing a man. To voice the interests of women as a whole. Finally if they were acting in a stereotypically/archetypal male fashion, as a general/commander/ruler. In this last case most figures adopted male patterns of behaviour and speech, even acknowledging this in some cases. Making themselves into men.\nVery short, with a very simple point, even though the world has changed s lot since Beard’s mother’s time, there is still a cultural holdover that at the very least makes it more difficult for women to - reach positions of power - effect change using that power\nBeard focuses on prestigious leadership positions, using examples of well-known female politicians. It would have been a longer book, but I would have liked some thoughts on power in mundane settings. Of course what she says applies to home-life, normal non-leadership positions etcetera, but it is left as an exercise for the reader and there might be interesting nuances in these other spheres. The book is effective but it hammers on a bit too much, I believe that’s the intention.\nAt the very end there is a bit on what to do? One suggestion she makes is to -paraphrasing- “think about power as an attribute or as a verb”. To power something, easier for me to understand that in the statistics sense, you need a large enough sample to “power” an analysis, and it makes sense, anyways.\nShould everyone read this book? Probably, it’s so short. I imagine many (unfortunately men) would recoil at the title, just like I did. When that happened I almost stopped but I had s thought. Why does this book exist, Mary Beard is a world-class scholar, her field is ancient history, Rome mainly then Greece. Her issue is not feminism, her issue is humanism. She knows and I think I do too know, that most of what’s written, about all issues, at all times, and by almost any author, is about and from the perspective of men. Any old non-fiction book that deals with a thing, like and event a war or even a concept I guess that could also be war is going to be about the human experience which, in literature has been presented as male. Thinking this, that almost any other book I pickup is written with males at the center, made it not only easy but edged me to continue reading.\n10/10"
