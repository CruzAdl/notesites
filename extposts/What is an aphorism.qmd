An aphorism is a brief/succinct/concise observation which encapsulates a general truth.

This blog post collects three of them.

“*Der Mensch kann tun was er will; er kann aber nicht wollen was er will.”*

“Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.”

*Arthur Schopenhauer*

“So Stark

Und Doch Verletzbar

Das Volk, Der Mensch

Der Wald, Der Baum”

“So strong

yet so vulnerable,

the People, the Person,

the Forest, the Tree”

*East Side Gallery, Berlin*

“Bananas are not the only fruit,

cookies are not a meal”

*Whitechapel, London, 2017*
